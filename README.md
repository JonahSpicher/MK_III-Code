# MK III Code
The official repository for all code on the MK III Car for Olin Electric Motorsports

## How to Github?
What a good question! Read Byron's tutorial on Git [here](https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/Programming_Tutorials/blob/master/GitTutorials/CheatSheet.md)

## Build Chain
We are currently still figuring our our build chain, so it's coming...trust us!

## Github Projects
This year we will be using Github projects to track our software progress throughout the year. You can learn more about it [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) but it's very similar to [trello](null "If you've ever used that...").

*Projects Overview*

Basically it consists of multiple project pages where you can track the progress of that project. Since OEM has such a large and broad scope of projects, I've attempted to simplify this by only having a few projects going on, but each project will probably have multiple sub-projects within it. We don't know if this will work for us or not, so your advice would be appreciated.
